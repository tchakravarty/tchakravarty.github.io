I have, in the past, tried to work out the exact relationship between a set of binary regressions on a sequence of binary outcomes, and duration modeling. An answer is provided by Glenn Sueyoshi in *A Class of Binary Response Models for Grouped Duration Data*, [published in the Journal of Applied Econometrics in 1995](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jae.3950100406). The data for this paper [is available on the JAE replication archive](http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/jae/1995-v10.4/sueyoshi/). Over the coming couple of weeks, I will try to replicate the results of this paper. From a cursory look, it seems that the computations are not that complex. 

As an aside, Glenn Sueyoshi spent a number of years in the late-80s & early-90s, after graduating from MIT Econ, at UCSD Econ, during its econometrics heyday.
