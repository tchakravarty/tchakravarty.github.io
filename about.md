I am an erstwhile econometrician, and now a data scientist (which I take to mean applied statistician). I work for [Fractal Analytics Inc.](http://www.fractalanalytics.com/), an analytics company based out of Mumbai, India. 

This page collects some of the projects that I work on in my free time, as well as a blog, mostly related to statistics and statistical computing.

I am happy to discuss any of the content on this site, or anything related to statistics. I am easiest to reach via email.
